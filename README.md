# React Boilerplate

This boilerplate is a React application with the most basic packages necessary to successfully get the 
application up, running and tested. You'll need to run the following code to get it going:

```
yarn
yarn start
```

This will install the packages for you using yarn. This tool might be somewhat new to you all, but
you can think of it as a tool that is very similar to npm to install your node packages. This software
is maintained by Facebook. It does some awesome work behind the scenes to optimize installing your packages
(notice how much quicker it installs), as well as creating a `yarn.lock` file to manage dependencies.

This setup also has testing for you as well so that you can build up your skills with Karma Enzyme testing!

Have fun creating your side projects!
